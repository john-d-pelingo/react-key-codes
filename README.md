# react-key-codes

⌨️ Reveal the JavaScript key codes on key d`own. Built with react and friends. Bootstrapped with the help of Facebook's create-react-app.

Try the demo at [https://keyboardcode.netlify.com/](https://keyboardcode.netlify.com/).

## Quick Setup

Install all of the application's dependencies:

`npm install` or `yarn install`

Next, you can start the application in a local environment with:

`npm install` or `yarn start`

The browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000` which
will display the application running.

Otherwise, you can build application into the `<rootDir>/build` directory with:

`npm run build` or `yarn build`

After that you can serve the optimized web application build at
`http://localhost:8080` by default locally with:

`npm run start:prod` or `yarn start:prod`
